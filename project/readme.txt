  This example is based on the GD32307C-EVAL-V1.1 board, it provides a
description of SysTick configuration, use of EVAL_COM and key. 
需要移植UART――DMA （可以配置的4个UART带DMA）
        ADC――DMA   （硬件过采样的16bit的ADC）
		SPI  driver finish 
		I2C
		TImer ---PWM  driver finish
		         PPM  PWM in driver finish
				 ISR  driver and ISR function frame finish
				 使用官方历程中的硬件初始化方法，来替换原来的stm的硬件初始化方法。
				 凡是涉及到硬件操作的都要使用官方提供的方法来操作。所以这次得移植将是大工程，很多地方要重新写和重构。
      功能测试还未开始。
 APP 层开始；2019-7-23
        TLE-5012B 
		FOC-driver
		uart 通讯，调试
		参数保存-parameter。
